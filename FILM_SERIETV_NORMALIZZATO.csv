Comedian Jeff Portnoy is best known for his leading roles in sophomoric comedies, and may be less well known for his rampant drug use. Five time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus is a serious method actor, who immerses himself in whatever the role. On location in southeast Vietnam, they are the stars of ""Tropic Thunder"", based on Vietnam war veteran 'Four Leaf' Tayback's memoirs of his rescue during the war, that rescue which was considered a near suicide mission for the assigned army force and resulted in him losing both hands. For his role, Caucasian Australian Lazarus even went through a controversial surgical skin dying procedure so that he could convincingly play a black man. Production is not going well since rookie director Damien Cockburn is unable to control the prima-donna attitude of his three stars. Cockburn and Tayback decide that the five primary actors - Speedman, Portnoy, Lazarus, rapper Alpa Chino, and newcomer Kevin Sandusky - need to work together as a unit as did their real life characters. The five are placed in the middle of the jungle, and with only a map and their prop machine guns in hand, are asked to work together to battle through the stunt pyrotechnics in their way. What none of the seven of them know is that they have been dropped into a real life drug war led by the Flaming Dragons. It isn't until Speedman is captured by the Flaming Dragons and tortured that they all realize that what they believed was make believe gunfire and land mines was actually real life. As the four actors try to figure out what to do concerning Speedman's situation, all five go through their own journey of self-discovery. Meanwhile, the movie's megalomaniacal profanity spewing producer Les Grossman and Speedman's faithful agent Rick Peck argue about what to do about Speedman's situation. And Tayback inadvertently shows a little of his true self. —Huggo",7.0,"Action,Comedy,War",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE5NjQzMDkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3ODI3MQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Wentworth,18,2013,100,45,tvSeries,Australia,"Fans of the iconic Prisoner Cell Block H series, which pushed boundaries over three decades ago and still boasts a loyal following worldwide today, will remember Bea Smith as gutsy and fearless, ruling Wentworth Correctional Centre with an iron fist. But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside. —ahmetkozan",8.6,"Crime,Drama",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDkxZmFhMDAtMmIyZS00NjAwLThlYjctZDQwMWQwYzdlYWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

The Founder,Not Rated,2016,1,115,movie,United States,"1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her than he is in selling, his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, it owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for ""his"" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities. —Huggo",7.2,"Biography,Drama",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzExNDg0MDk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE1Mjg0MDI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters.

Contestants had to respond in question form (""What is Hanes?"") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was ""always in jeopardy"") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a ""Daily Double"" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into ""Double Jeopardy!"" Gameplay was the same in ""Double Jeopardy!"" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two ""Daily Double"" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the ""Double Jeopardy!"" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play ""Final Jeopardy!""; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a ""Clue Crew"" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going ""on location""), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of ""celebrity guests"" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>",8.2,Game-Show,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM3ZjkwNjEtNzNiOS00OThhLTkxOTQtODg3MTEyN2E1ZDgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU2NDQ3NjU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

After financing the trips with loans and donations, they set off on an epic 101-day-long trip across 8000 kilometers, while the world was waiting for the result of the trip. The film tells about the origin of the idea, the preparations, and the events on the trip. The ""Kon-Tiki"" was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, and ""Kon-Tiki"" is an old name for this god. Heyerdahl filmed the expedition, which later became the Academy Award winning documentary in 1951, and he wrote a book about the expedition that was translated into 70 languages and sold more than 50 millions copies around the world. Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times, although most anthropologists now believe they did not. Anyway he proved that it was possible by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at that time. The trip took 101 days over 4,300 miles across the Pacific Ocean before the ""Kon-Tiki"" crashed onto the dangerous reefs outside Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947.

Felt not getting the job is arguably due to he being such an integral figure in the controversial Hoover tenure. One of the first cases for the Bureau in Gray's tenure is a break-in at and bugging of the Democratic National Committee offices, the case unofficially called Watergate for the complex in which the break-in occurred. Ordered by Gray by what what seems to be unofficial orders passed down from the White House, FBI staff are hamstrung in their investigation, Watergate which has seeming ties to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President and thus possibly the Republican administration in the White House. For the first time in his career, Felt decides to go rogue in an effort for the FBI to gain back its independence without interference by any other organization, including especially the White House. Those rogue actions are largely the treasonous offense of leaking FBI information into the Watergate investigation to the media, first to his friend, Time reporter Sandy Smith, then to Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, their source - Felt - known in the public mindset through the code name, Deep Throat. Through the process, Felt tries to protect himself from discovery and protect his FBI associates from innuendo each as possibly being Deep Throat, which becomes more and more difficult with the reelection of Richard Nixon, his administration which uses every tool in their legal and illegal toolbox, including through their patsy Gray, to discover the identity of Deep Throat. —Huggo",6.4,"Biography,Drama,History",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMDEwMjMyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA1NTA1MzI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

The Accountant of Auschwitz,PG,2018,1,80,movie,Canada,"Oskar Gröning was one of the last surviving members of the SS to be implicated in Nazi crimes against humanity. Becoming known as the ""Accountant of Auschwitz,"" he was charged with the murder of 300,000 Jews after coming to wider attention for his appearance on the BBC documentary series Auschwitz: The Nazis & the 'Final Solution' (2005).

As survivors travel to Germany to testify, the heinous acts of the Holocaust remain vivid and traumatic. For some, there is no room for debate: Gröning was witness and therefore complicit, regardless of his duty to follow orders. Others look at a frail man in the last years of his life and see no reason to pursue charges.

Unfortunately, after becoming a little too pompous and arrogant, Richard ends up insulting the Isle of Man and his fellow cast members on the Wogan chat-show, including his on-screen and real-life love interest Patricia Deville (Essie Davies), his stuntman (Simon Farnaby), and bit-part co-star Peter Easterman (Steve Coogan). He decides to leave to try and make it big in Hollywood, but twenty-five years later he's balding in a flat in North London and has recently been replaced for an orthopaedic sock advertisement by John Nettles, much to his chagrin. He is even more jealous that Easterman now fronts a long-running spin-off show which has far eclipsed the success of Mindhorn. Richard has an unexpected opportunity to reignite his career though when a delusional criminal calling himself ""The Kestrel"" (Russell Tovey) starts terrorizing the Isle of Man and, having an extremely unhealthy obsession with the show, demands to talk only to Mindhorn. Relishing a chance for publicity, Richard dons his turtleneck and robot eye, aggravates the police with his method acting, tries to rekindle his old romance with Patricia, and also attempts to sign a Mindhorn DVD deal with Eastman. With his 1980s political incorrectness, solo musical single, useless cyborg eyepatch, and cheesy one-liners, Mindhorn is here to bring an apocalypse of justice.

Jonas,13+,2018,1,82,tvMovie,France,"Boys (Jonas) is a mystery told in two separate timelines. In the first, it's 1997 and Jonas is entering 9th grade. A new boy in school immediately catches his eye. Perhaps it's the bad-boy scar on his cheek or his devil-may-care attitude, but Jonas is smitten. The two boys quickly become friends and before long are skipping class to kiss in an empty gymnasium. In the film's other timeline, it's 2015 and the excitement of a teenager in love has been replaced with the sorrow of a man who can't escape the past. The adult version of Jonas (Félix Maritaud, outstanding in this year's sexually graphic Sauvage and last year's ImageOut favorite BPM) is a broken man. His boyfriend has thrown him out for cheating on him a few too many times, and he's been arrested for getting into a fight at Boys, a local gay bar. There's something about the bar that seems to set him off. He meanders through life still carrying that same old Game Boy, trying to fill a hole that can't be filled. So what happened to turn this innocent teenager into the sad, angry man that we see now? Boys (Jonas) is an engrossing mystery that will keep you guessing from the first minute to the last. As it moves back and forth between its two timelines, the film succeeds as both a sweet coming-of-age love story and a dark suspense thriller. As these two perfectly-told stories intertwine, it makes for a totally unique and truly special cinematic experience. -- Stephen K.

La trinchera infinita,G,2019,1,147,movie,Spain,"The film starts in 1936. In a small and remote inland town of Andalusia (southern Spain), Higinio is a tailor and a town councilor who has recently got married to Rosa. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Higinio hides in his own house awaiting the right moment to escape with his wife. But he is caught in his attempt by his neighbor, Gonzalo, who blames Higinio for his brother's death and is looking for revenge. Captured by Franco's soldiers, Higinio is driven by truck, along with other opposition prisoners, to a nearby prison. But an unwitting distraction from one of the prisoners gives him a chance to escape. He runs across the town to his house where he is to remain hidden in a secret hole. In the meantime, Gonzalo pays Higinio's wife occasional visits in the belief that she knows his whereabouts. When the civil war comes to an end in 1939, Higinio learns from Rosa that there is a reward for capturing him as well as other insurgents. After one of her father-in-law's visit, Rosa and Higinio's father succeed in moving Higinio into the father's house. But, to their surprise, Higinio's father dies of natural causes and Rosa inherits and moves into her father-in-law's house with Higinio as the secret occupant. Rosa takes charge of her late father-in-law's sewing shop. But, with time, troubles increase: Rosa is raped by Rodrigo, a young Civil Guard and one of her regular customers. Higinio kills him and buries the body in Higinio's hiding place. A few months later Rosa tells Higinio that she's pregnant. Despite Higinio's opposition, and unsure of the paternity of the child, Rosa abandons Higinio for a few months to visit her sister in order to hide her pregnancy to the rest of the town. Alone in the house, Higinio surprises the local postman with his male lover after they break into his theoretically empty house which they intend to use as their love nest. The two of them befriend Higinio, and they promise to keep their mutual secrets. When, in 1945, World War II ends, Higinio's hopes for Allied forces defeating Franco's regime and freeing the country gradually vanish. He continues his seclusion for years to come, living with daily fear and paranoia. Jaime, Rosa's and (presumably) Higinio's son, is taught to say that he is Rosa's nephew and that his parents died when he was a baby. With the house turned into a big cell, Higinio and Rosa's relationship deteriorates due to decades of isolation, guilt and shame. In 1963, Jaime, having grown up up as an idealistic young man and, tired of a life of fear and terror, welcomes a friend home. The friend is wanted by Franco's police forces and Jaime introduces him to his father, who learns that there are many others like him in hiding. At the same time, Jaime confronts his parents about the life he has had and a determined Gonzalo keeps visiting Rosa's sewing shop, still tormented by his brother death, and obsessed with the idea of seeking revenge and kill Higinio at any cost. But then, in 1969, Higinio's life changes after he hears a special news on the radio. —Chockys",7.2,"Action,Drama,History",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI5NjRlZjctODM0OC00MjkwLTlmMjQtOTNhOTM4OTA1YWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM2Mzg4MA@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,PG-13,2017,1,105,movie,Greece,"When Stonewall Veteran and beloved Greenwich Village personality Marsha P Johnson turned up dead shortly after Gay Pride in 1992, it was the latest in a series of murders, gay bashings, and ""mysterious"" deaths in the local gay community. Johnson is seen in footage at a political march shortly before this, at an action trying to draw attention to these hate crimes. Tragically, Johnson then becomes the next victim. Like the other suspicious deaths, Johnson's death is quickly dismissed as a ""suicide"", even though there is no evidence that Johnson was suicidal, and significant evidence that Johnson was harassed and stalked on that very night. Demonstrations are held to protest the lack of police investigation, but it is not until decades later that transgender crime advocate Victoria Cruz succeeds in getting some answers. Even after decades, many contemporaries of Johnson are still afraid to discuss on the record what happened to Johnson, the murders that took place in the Village in that era, the danger that follows many of the most marginalized in the community, and the threats that some still fear. Like the previous documentary on Marsha P Johnson, Pay it No Mind, this film relies on archival footage of the dead, letting the subjects speak for themselves. Footage of Johnson at political actions is included, though some might not notice Johnson at first at some of these actions and memorials, dressed down in jeans and a t-shirt, or jeans and a flannel shirt, with no wig. Stonewall veterans, AIDS activists, and early gender nonconforming and transgender activists are shown at these demonstrations, as well.

The Battered Bastards of Baseball,PG-13,2014,1,80,movie,United States,"The Battered Bastards of Baseball is one of baseball's last great, unheralded true stories. In 1973, Hollywood veteran Bing Russell (best known for playing Deputy Clem on ""Bonanza"") created the only independent baseball team in America at the time, the legendary Portland Mavericks. Bing operated without a Major League affiliation while playing in a city that was considered a wasteland for professional baseball. Tryouts for the Mavericks, which were open to the public, were filled with hopefuls who arrived in droves from every state in America, many of whom had been rejected by organized baseball. Skeptics agreed it would never work. But Bing's Mavericks generated unprecedented success: they shattered attendance records, signed Kurt Russell - Bing's son - as a player and team Vice President, produced the most successful batboy in baseball (filmmaker Todd Field), re-launched the controversial career of Jim Bouton, hired the first female general manager in Baseball, and inspired one of America's beloved bubblegums - Big League Chew. The Battered Bastards of Baseball is as much about the independent spirit as it is about baseball. The Mavericks' in your face attitude was contagious to fans, and during their short reign, they - and Bing Russell - basically held up their middle finger to the sports establishment and said we're playing this game on our terms, not yours. They were the real life Bad News Bears. —Anonymous",8.0,"Documentary,Sport",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NDQwNTU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1MDUyMjE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

"Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator",PG-13,2019,1,86,movie,United States,"Bikram Choudhury was at the forefront of popularizing yoga in North America and around the world. An Indian immigrant with a Beverly Hills base, Choudhury was a born entertainer, known for dressing in nothing more than a black speedo and a Rolex. His teaching style was tough love sprinkled with salty language and punctuated by spontaneous bursts of singing. His followers hailed him for helping them to gain confidence, lose weight, and overcome physical ailments through his specialty of hot yoga. He built a franchise empire with hundreds of Bikram studios around the world. Filmmaker Eva Orner traces Choudhury from his rise in the 1970s to his disgrace in accusations of rape and sexual harassment in more recent years. She taps a vast trove of archival footage that demonstrates Choudhury's charm and offers clues to his dark side. She conducts extensive interviews with his one-time acolytes who now feel betrayed, including yoga devotee Sarah Baughn who brought serious charges against him years before the reckoning of the #MeToo movement, and Choudhury's long-time lawyer Micki Jafa-Bodden. Over the years, Choudhury's story has received steady press coverage, but there is a fresh power in this telling, with key figures going on camera to describe their complicated journey. The film raises larger questions about the nature of leaders and followers and the corruption of messianic figures. To this day, Choudhury has evaded prosecution and continues to attract yoga students from all over the world, bringing added tension to this rigorous investigation. —Toronto International Film Festival",6.7,"Crime,Documentary",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEzNjU0MTQtNDNlNS00Y2U5LWE5ZmItYWMxNjVhOTRhMzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Forks Over Knives,PG,2011,1,96,movie,United States,"What has happened to us? Despite the most advanced medical technology in the world, we are sicker than ever by nearly every measure. Cases of diabetes are exploding, especially amongst our younger population. About half of us are taking at least one prescription drug and major medical operations have become routine. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the country's three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to ""battle"" these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases. Could it be there's a single solution to all of these problems? A solution so comprehensive, but so utterly straightforward, that it's mind-boggling that more of us haven't taken it seriously? FORKS OVER KNIVES examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the so-called ""diseases of affluence"" that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods. The major storyline in the film traces the personal journeys of Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional scientist from Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, a former top surgeon at the world renowned Cleveland Clinic. Inspired by remarkable discoveries in their young careers, these men conducted several groundbreaking studies, one of which is considered among the most comprehensive health-related investigations ever undertaken. Their research separately and independently led them to the same startling conclusion: degenerative diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even several forms of cancer, could almost always be prevented-and in many cases reversed-by adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet. Despite the profound implications of their findings, their work has remained relatively unknown to the public. In addition, cameras follow ""reality patients"" who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes. Doctors teach these patients how to adopt a whole foods plant-based diet as the primary approach to treat their ailments-while the challenges and triumphs of their journeys are revealed. —Brian L.

There's Something in the Water,18+,2019,1,73,movie,Canada,"Elliot Page and Gaycation collaborator Ian Daniel shift gears with the documentary There's Something in the Water, a disturbing and, frankly, terrifying portrait of ecological and social disasters in Page's native Nova Scotia. Based on Ingrid Waldron's incendiary study, the film follows Page as she travels to rural areas of the province that are plagued by toxic fallout from industrial development. As did Waldron, the filmmakers discover that these catastrophes have been precisely placed, all in remote, low income - and very often Indigenous or Black - communities. As the filmmakers observe, your postal code determines your health. We're introduced to many courageous women. Louise, from Shelburne, gives us a tour of a neighborhood in her hometown where every house has been affected by cancer. Michele fights to protect ""A?se?k"", or Boat Harbour, once a sanctuary for Indigenous people, now plagued by toxins spewed by a pulp and paper mill. The government only began addressing this when other whiter, wealthier communities were affected. (In one stomach-churning moment, it's explained that the company went to great effort to divert the offal towards ""A?se?k"".) And a group of ""Mi?gmaq"" activists known as The Grandmothers fight to protect a river threatened by a gas company. All of it is deeply sobering and scary, but like Page and Daniel we may find solace in the bravery of their subjects, who are the kind of resourceful and compassionate people you should place your bets on. If, as Louise poignantly asks, you don't care about other people, ""What do you get up for every day?"" —Toronto International Film Festival",6.6,Documentary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Y2MTkxYzItZGE3Ni00MTY1LTg4YjMtM2NjNTUyOWYwZjU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Beyond Pete's death, it is not a good time for Karen as she already owes her editor new material, she not telling her editor that she has a major case of writer's block. Juliet, who never met her grandfather or knew about her mother's Lousiana past, has no emotional attachment to this trip, she who would have much rather spent Christmas in New York City with her friends in the comfort of big city life. Karen not so much left but ran away from her past in leaving twenty years ago. Now, she wants to sell Pete's ranch as quickly as possible to run away once again to put this part of her life permanently behind her. It won't be that easy for Karen as she not only learns from Pete's best friend, Judge Brandon Lawrence who is administering the legal aspects of the estate, that the ranch operation is deep in arrears on many payments - money Karen doesn't have - but that there is no known will. In addition, Hugh Anderson, with who Karen has a turbulent history (the two who were once engaged before she ran off), who Pete treated like a son, and who had long helped Pete maintain the ranch, has a proverbial ""back of the envelope"" written, albeit undated, agreement from Pete for half the ranch, which Karen, in her turbulent relationship with Hugh, intends to fight.

Bangistan,UA,2015,1,135,movie,India,"Bangistan is a whip smart and uproarious satire on fundamentalism and the story of two unlikely terrorists, the antitheses of each other, with a common destructive goal. Concerned by the unrest in the name of religion, Subcontinental leaders of Muslims and Hindus, the Imam and the Shankaracharya, announce that they're attending the International Peace Conference in Krakow in a joint effort to help unite the two religions in perpetual harmony. Rival rabble-rousing ragtag organizations, the Islamist Al-Kaam Tamam and right-wing political party Maa Ka Dal separately recruit and brainwash Hafeez and Praveen to suicide bomb the conference so that they may continue to wield their local influence. After a rigorous, and hilarious, 'training' period the two men switch their religious identities to stay under the radar. Hafeez, the jihadi, masquerades as a conservative Hindu, Ishwarchand; while Praveen, the Hindu soldier, dons the garb of a practicing Muslim, Allahrakha. Focused on the mission, they reach Krakow and end up staying together in the same apartment. The two men go great lengths to protect their real identities from the world and each other as they acquire bombs and plan their mission, teetering on the edge of revelation at key moments. Their adventures involve a local cop on their scent and desperate to make a name for himself, the foxy pub owner who takes the two under her wings, a Bangladeshi fixer out to make a quick buck, the assortment of locals they meet, and the cultural impact of their exotic experiences in the city thrown into the mix. A series of serendipitous comic events ends in an epic, dramatic, finale that brings the world to Krakow and covers the range of emotions, leaving you breathless while sending across a universally affirmative message that all religions are but different doorways to the same destination. —Dhruvi Dokania",4.5,"Comedy,Drama",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMwYmZjZWUtNjQxMi00NzhjLTgxZTUtNjA5OGQ0ZjQzNzc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

"Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2",PG,2014,1,88,movie,United States,"What began as the story of one man, is now a story about millions. After the film ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" documented his 60 day juice fast, Joe Cross vowed never to go on camera again. Since then, more than 20 million people have seen the film and Joe realized there's still a lot for him to learn about becoming healthy and staying that way. ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2"" taps into the tsunami of positive change that's sweeping the world when it comes to what we eat. As Joe sets out to learn how to be healthy in an unhealthy world, he talks to a wide range of experts, follows up with folks from the first film, and connects with new people along the way. Each one helps Joe learn that healthy eating is only one aspect of living a healthy life. From stay-at-home moms to world-class surgeons to office workers in Kenya, it seems like everyone is trying to be healthier, yet struggling to do so. While on the road, Joe experiences some ups and downs when it comes to managing his own weight. Joe's food battles resemble those of the everyday people he meets on his journey. Mirroring Joe's story is a series of testimonial videos submitted by people who saw the first film; their personal, intimate and often funny stories show that wanting to change is often easier than actually doing so. Top cardiologist Dean Ornish catches Joe by surprise when he explains that community is one of the most powerful forces in shaping a person's health. Joe finds out how true this really is when he catches up with Phil Staples, the truck-driver from the first film. Five years on, Phil is his own journey with varying levels of support and is dealing with his own set of ups and downs. It's Phil's experience that shows Joe just how big of an impact community can have. Through Joe's journey and the lives of the people he meets, Joe shows us in Fat Sick & Nearly Dead 2 that most people really do have control over of their health, even if they never knew it was possible. And that the final decision about what to put in your mouth, is what Joe calls, ""The last two feet of freedom."" —Anonymous",6.4,Documentary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU2NTE0MzkwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk4OTI3MjE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Revolver Rani,UA,2014,1,132,movie,India,"In the hostile territory of Chambal, the land of rebels, politicians, bullets and blood, you either live by the gun or die by the gun. Revolver Rani is set in this hostile world where there are no friends; only fragile alliances and deadly enemies that aim straight for the head. But sometimes you do not need to take lives to finish your enemies. Sometimes you just need to go for their heart. Revolver Rani is a satirical and unusual love story set against the backdrop of politics. It's about Alka Singh (Kangana Ranaut), the leader of a political party and her obsessive love for Rohan Mehra (Vir Das), a rising star of Bollywood. The elections in Gwalior have just finished and Alka's reign has come to an end. Her opposition, the Tomar party, have come into power and want to use their new position to take out Alka, but first, they want to hurt her. The Tomars kidnap Rohan from Mumbai and take him back to Gwalior with the aim to kill him. They are about to pull the trigger when Revolver Rani turns up, all guns blazing and saves his life. Revolver Rani has a very unique story at its heart that has only ever been hinted at before in Bollywood. This film will bring that story into the limelight and show the viewers what would happen if a political giant fell in love with a Bollywood star and then had to protect him from her enemies. It's a very authentic satire, littered with dead bodies, love and black comedy that builds up to an iconic climax set in the Shivpuri Bird Sanctuary (Madhya Pradesh) just before the break of dawn. Even if she is deadly, Revolver Rani needs love too. —Anonymous",4.5,"Action,Comedy,Crime",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmE0NjQ3NDgtODRhYi00YTRjLThhNWUtNjMxNjJhZDczN2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Louder Than a Bomb,PG,2010,1,99,movie,United States,"Hailed as ""one of the most inspiring and exhilarating documentaries in years"" (Steve Pond, The Wrap), Louder Than a Bomb tells the story of four Chicago high school poetry teams as they prepare for and compete in the world's largest youth slam.

Web Junkie,PG-13,2013,1,74,movie,Israel,"The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. 'Web Junkie' identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",6.4,"Biography,Documentary,Drama",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MTIxNzU4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA4MjI4MDE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

This reconnection is personified by Ambrosio, her father and the mayor of San Fermin, with whom she had broken off relations fifteen years before. Soon Juana is going to discover that San Fermin, like many other small towns in Latin America, has become a sort of backyard to the capital and home to a large, unpopular, and undesired landfill. After saving a girl from a fire and becoming an unexpected heroine, Juana will be convinced that she can give something back to the welcoming community by working with her father on the city council. After a while, Juana will uncover a dark case of political corruption that directly involves her father and the powerful company that manages the town's landfill. This will lead her to become an inexperienced but convictional mayor, who courageously faces the various injustices that the town suffers. In the midst of enormous sacrifices to her personal life and family, Juana and her loyal team fight to mobilize the people and demand that central government put a stop to corruption.

Richard is the good brother, who, despite his benevolence, is a lost soul. He is an artist and a wanderer, a poet and a lover. Truly, no words can adequately praise John Togo's performance as both brothers. He is simply breathtaking in every single frame he's in, and thank God, he's in almost every one. Not only is he wholesomely convincing as both characters, but he goes above and beyond that. He becomes two people so seamlessly that, not for a single moment was there a doubt in my mind as to who I was watching at any given scene. It's an award-worthy performance, and Togo becomes a leading man of such cinematic proportion, that he makes the film completely irresistible, despite its psychological labyrinth and attention-demanding plot, one that will challenge you to question reality as you can't take your eyes off screen. Of course, there are many other things besides Togo that you can't take your eyes off. —Jon Milken",3.5,Thriller,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0NTg5MDQ2MTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ2MDU4OTc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Champs,PG-13,2014,1,85,movie,United States,"This epic story of the rise of three of the most successful boxers of our time challenges the perception of the American Dream through the intimately personal life trajectories of Evander Holyfield, Bernard Hopkins and Mike Tyson. Much like modern day gladiators, our protagonists come from the bottom rungs of society, choosing the path of boxing or ""the poor man's sport,"" as a last resort, and an alternative to much bleaker options such as prison or, worse yet, death. Following these fighters' paths from success to self-discovery, they recount their battles while illuminating our country's most critical social issues, including the struggle with poverty, racial inequality, broken homes, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and the failures of our educational and prison systems. CHAMPS unearths the unique resilience of these men in the face of life's most difficult obstacles - from personal finance to sustained brain injury - and highlights how our society and their industry exalts their fleeting success, but leaves them without the skills, protections, medical care and training that they need to succeed outside of the ring.

Salam - The First ****** Nobel Laureate,13+,2018,1,75,movie,United States,"""Salam"" is a feature length documentary about the Nobel prize winning Pakistani physicist, Abdus Salam. The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a ""Qadiani""-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious.",7.9,Documentary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE1NjA2NzMtZmI5OS00NTdhLWI3YjItZWIyZGU4ZWEzZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3ODA1OQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

La limita de jos a cerului,13+,2013,1,80,movie,Moldova,"The Unsaved is a drama about about a Sancho Panza and not a Don Quijote. It's about the every day's non-hero facing circumstances and not adventures, it's about Viorel, a 25-year-old fledgling drug dealer, from a backwater little town in the contemporary Republic of Moldova. He lives at home with his mother, his ears get red when he's nervous and he lets his days pass in the usual ""laissez-faire"" Moldavian style. He gets involved through his best friend, Goose, in small-time drug dealing, while helping him to fly a hang glider that never seems to work properly; and he falls in love with Maria, the girl who happens to cut his hair. This easy-going existentialism precipitates several possibilities, which find our hero trapped in his own indecisiveness, so finally he reckons the moment has come for him to start growing up and act like an adult. The first thing he does is get a job peeling potatoes in the police canteen in order to make his mother proud. The second thing is to quit the drug dealing and become a serious man, but not before stealing a car engine to ""tune"" Goose's hang glider or delivering some drugs in his place. The third thing as an adult is to develop a serious relationship with a young woman, Maria, who is the lover of a drug dealer in jail, and at the same time a cop's mistress of convenience. All these attempts fail to lead him to the desired state of ""adulthood"", and our man-boy becomes less and less a hero, and more of a man just trying to get by. Cornered by the cops, Viorel exchanges his freedom for his best friend. He chooses not to fight for Maria and lets her go back to her cruel lover who gets out of prison. In the end, left all alone, he sees himself faced only with a dream, Goose's broken hang glider. The naivety he brought to stealing as in loving, the persistent urge to find the meaning of life through others, the careless way in letting the hours pass by, and finally the choice of believing that flying means only falling, are just few of the little dramas that turn the prosaic poetry of this story into a liberation struggle of the day to day life. —Anonymous",6.9,Drama,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI2ZTFiYWMtZGJkNC00MjMyLTgxMzYtMmRkMDMyNTAxYTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgxMDU4NTU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Hikaru Utada: Laughter in the Dark Tour 2018,PG,2019,1,141,movie,Japan,"If there was anyone you could call a true queen of J-pop, it's most definitely Utada Hikaru. She's one of the best selling artists in Japan of all time, with her debut album hitting almost 10 million copies sold. For many Western fans, she was one of the first Japanese artists to become truly popular, largely in part to a little song called ""Simple and Clean"" from the first Kingdom Hearts game. Her latest album ""Hatsukoi"" came out last year and in support, she embarked on her first full Japan tour in 12 years; ""Laughter In The Dark"". It completely sold out, and she's big enough to play stadium-sized venues. In a surprising announcement, when home and digital release details came out for a live filming of the tour, it included a Netflix announcement. The concert was filmed at the legendary Makuhari Messe in Chiba and was the final stop of her ""Laughter In The Dark"" tour. An absolutely much watch performance to be sure. She's a living legend for good reason; Utada Hikaru has one of the best voices in the world and the charisma to back it up. I was lucky enough to catch her live in New York City almost 10 years when she did a small string of shows in the states. To this day, I haven't forgotten a single moment of that night. I fell to the ground in awe when she busted out ""Passion"" from Kingdom Hearts II and doubly so when she encored with ""Simple and Clean"". There's a reason why her combined singles sales are well into double-digit millions, why her entire recent tour completely sold out, why she was chosen to represent the enormously popular Kingdom Hearts and Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Aluna,18+,2012,1,89,movie,Colombia,"The Kogi once traded with Maya and Aztecs. Their civilization still survives hidden on Colombia's highest mountain. They believe they are guardians of the world. Their leaders are trained from infancy in darkness to work by connecting with 'aluna', a cosmic consciousness. They perceive 'black lines' that connect special sites essential to life. In 1990, convinced that we were destroying the earth, they sent a warning through a British film-maker and then withdrew. They have now concluded that we cannot have grasped the warning and they have to explain it better if the world is to survive. So they recalled the film-maker and instructed him to film their demonstration of these connections, using 400km of gold thread. So begins a truly bizarre journey. We see people who have no wheel or writing, who know nothing of our world, seriously discussing dark energy with a leading astronomer and correctly identifying objects seen by the Hubble telescope. But as the journey gets under way they gradually realize that the film-maker has no idea what they are trying to demonstrate and their own arguments are treated as fantasy by a local biologist. So they change tack, taking us up into their mountain to show exactly what they mean, and then coming down to join forces with leading scientists who recognize that this is important cutting-edge knowledge dealing with a very grave issue. Their journey leads to apocalyptic horror, but in an astonishing resolution ends with an extraordinary joyful celebration of new life. —Alan Ereira",7.7,"Adventure,Documentary",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MDczMzIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1NDExOQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

The genre then shifted to political films of the collective downtrodden facing the state. The genre ended, spent, in comedy and farce. Along the way, argues this documentary, the spaghetti western established a language of filmmaking rooted in post-war cynicism and moral ambiguity, with cinematic tropes, including close-ups, violence, and soundtracks, that influenced filmmaking in Hong Kong and the U.S. —<jhailey@hotmail.com>",7.2,Documentary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDgxMDA5ZTYtMmIwMC00NWRiLTg1MGEtNWZmY2ZhNWEwZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTExNjk5Mzc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Striking extraordinary deals with the government to acquire newly privatized industries, a small group of men became phenomenally rich almost overnight. The most successful of these oligarchs was Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who quickly became the wealthiest man in Russia. But Khodorkovsky was invested not only in business, but also in true social reform and a new ideal of an open society, an attitude that ran afoul of the absolute rule of Vladimir Putin.

A Tiger in the Dark: The Decadence Saga,PG-13,2014,1,128,video,United States,"This is the story of a secret plot concocted by a ruthless crime syndicate which many people think doesn't exist.

Authorities reported that the people behind the devious plot (which sent police on a wild goose chase) still remain at large and are planning something much more sinister then they first assumed. Though, evasive and vague this film recounts those events and sends a chilling message to all those who watch it. —RHM Media Productions",7.7,Drama,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/social/imdb_logo.png

In World War Two, the Japanese presented themselves as Asia's liberators, but proved a particularly cruel occupying power. Yet the Allied victory meant liberation only in the sense of resuming colonialism, which native nationalists started to rebel against, as part of a wave of largely communist-inspired independence movements. Their leader Ho-Chi-Minh, one of a hundred pseudonyms, started theirs, the Viet Minh, initially not communist, but I the Cold War ended up following the Korean example, welcoming Chinese backing. The new de facto leaders transformed it into the Viet Kong, a guerrilla army liberating the north and a resistance movement in the south, where the French remained in control. After their bloody surprise defeat in Dien Bien Phu in the last rush to the peace agreement, the US took their place, fearing the 'domino theory' all of Asia could fall next to the red danger. —KGF Vissers",8.5,"Documentary,History,War",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc0ZDE2MjAtZDU5ZS00MzE2LWFjMTYtMjk5MGUxMzdmYWMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODAxMzczMjg@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

 P.O.V.,PG-13,2015,1,74,tvEpisode,Israel,"The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. Web Junkie (2013) identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Ran Tao established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age. —Anonymous",8.2,Documentary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/imdb/images/social/imdb_logo.png

But she knows she isn't happy, as she once tried to commit suicide while in college, is on a plethora of prescription medications to deal with her anxiety, and her whole life has been spent on her career primarily at the urging of her controlling mother. It isn't until she runs into Josh Chan, who she hasn't seen in ten years, they who dated at summer camp that year and he who broke up with her at the end of camp, that she realizes that what would make her happy is being with Josh. The problem is is that he, after living in New York for eight months and not being able to make it there, has decided to go home to West Covina, California, where he says everyone is ""happy"". So Rebecca decides to be happy by declining the promotion and packing up and moving to West Covina on the premise that she has a job there, while really it's to pursue Josh. She does find a job easily at Whitefeather & Associates, a second rate law firm (as they all are in West Covina), with some of her new coworkers suspect of why a Yale and Harvard graduate would give up a good job in New York for a second rate one in West Covina. In trying to track down Josh, Rebecca meets Greg Serrano, a bartender at a local joint, he who is a childhood friend of Josh's and who Rebecca uses at any opportunity to find Josh. If Rebecca were to look closer in other avenues, she may find that she has kindred spirits in West Covina, one as potential love interest, and another who believes in the pursuit of true love. —Huggo",7.8,"Comedy,Musical",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzYwYzM5MDktZDgzOC00NTI5LWFkOTQtNTBiZDU3MDc0NGI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjYyNDMwOQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Non-elected Tom, who was appointed from an academic career, and the President often do not see eye to eye, the latter who is losing political respect for the former. As such, the President has not included any initiatives raised by Tom in the address, and has informed Tom through his Chief of Staff Charlie Langdon that he will soon be demoted to a position based in Montreal (which is framed as a promotion) or fired if he does not accept the demotion. Further, Tom has been assigned the designated survivor for the address, meaning that he will be housed in a secret secured bunker while the rest of the Cabinet enjoys the public visibility by joining the President at the Capitol for the address. Things for all involved change drastically when the Capitol is bombed during the address - the perpetrators initially unknown - with the President and the rest of the Cabinet killed in the process, leading to Tom being appointed President, something he never saw happening or to which he would ever aspire. Tom is insecure enough in his own abilities at this crucial time, which is only exacerbated by similar views by others, including Seth Wheeler, who was President Richmond's head speech writer, and Harris Cochrane, the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Tom knows he has to look and sound Presidential to show the world that it is business as usual, meaning that his first speech, to be written by Seth in less than an hour, is of utmost importance. However, there are actions behind the scenes that could affect what happens. Through it all, Tom needs the emotional support of his family - his wife Alex, his teenaged son Leo, and adolescent daughter Penny - each who may be going through their own issues in dealing with the situation. —Huggo",8.2,"Action,Drama,Mystery",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRiZjBiY2QtMWJiYi00MjI5LWI2ZTYtNDg3ZDFmMjJiMWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQzNTgxMTA@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg

Sokka tries to sneak away, but Toph sends him flying into a makeshift pinball machine formed out of the vertical side of a cliff and into Appa's mouth. Aang saves him, catching him in the air with his bending. Sokka thanks Aang and subsequently remarks that he is ""sick and tired of being everyone's personal dummy.""Aang promptly fills Sokka with air, inflating him like a balloon. He begins to float away, but when Appa's horn pokes Sokka's nose, the ""puffed up Sokka"" explodes. He subsequently crash lands into a pool of water, emerging carrying a fish in one hand.Zuko and Iroh suddenly appear on top of a cliff. Zuko shouts to them, asking if ""[they] call that bending"". Katara's eyes turn into hearts and she exclaims that the tiny Zuko looked cute. Zuko becomes enraged and steam begins coming out of his nostrils and mouth, and he yells that he is neither cute nor tiny, and briefly reverts to his appearance in the series. Iroh agrees with Katara, causing Zuko's temper to flare and he shoots a large blast of fire at the gang. The blast hits Sokka directly, causing the fish he was holding to catch fire and cook.Zuko claims that fire is the best and Toph takes it as a bending battle challenge. She begins to raise mountains out of the earth, and when she has finished she shows the others an aerial photograph of the mountains which form a picture of herself. Momo promptly holds up a ""7.6"" sign, Appa an ""8.2"", and Iroh claps with amazement.Aang makes a large ball of air, and using it as a trampoline, launches himself into the air, and while doing so, he breaks a piece of a cloud off and takes a bite out of it. He flies up to outer space, comes back down to earth, and lands on the ground. Momo puts up a ""6"" sign, Appa an ""8"", and Iroh shakes his finger in disappointment. Aang points out that through his performance he had made an arrow shape out of the clouds. Momo subsequently flips the ""6"" over to make a ""9"", Appa turns his ""8"" over, even though this did not change its value, and Iroh looks impressed.A nearby volcano erupts and Zuko is riding the lava. He uses his firebending to make a dragon out of the lava, shouting that he will ""bring in the heat"". Katara bursts his bubble by riding a giant wave over Zuko's dragon, putting his fire out, and leaving behind a little rock dinosaur created by the fusion of the magma and water.Iroh says that each element has its own strengths and weaknesses. Sokka eats the burnt fish as Iroh promptly claims fire is the best. He and his nephew make a quick escape, vanishing in a cloud of dust before anyone can argue.",8.6,"Animation,Comedy,Family",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I2OWRhMjktYmJmMS00ZDYxLWE3NTAtNTdiNDUyZTk3ODA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzE5MDUxODM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg
